# MyStundenplan HTTP API documentation

This repository is a collection of useful information about the *myStundenplan* web service offered by *PRIMUSS Campus IT*. Along the reverse engineered HTTP API documentation it also contains request examples, data schemas and access considerations.

> *myStundenplan* is proprietary software with no official API specification available. Future developement might deprecate this documentation. There is no guarantee that the documented behaviour stays stable. As *myStundenplan* shows no version information to end users, it's impossible to correlate a documentation version to a specific software version. Therefore this repository is considered to match the latest version.
